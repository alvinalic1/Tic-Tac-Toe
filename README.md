# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Asks for first players input for name and preffered character followed by second player
You make your move by using the row and column numbers
After each move, the board is displayed and the game checks for a winner
If no winner, you keep playing
If there is a winner, game stops and prints winner


Still need to add conditionals to make sure a player can't add a character if that spot has already been played
